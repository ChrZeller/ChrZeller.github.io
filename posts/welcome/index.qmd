## What started it
During my journey with the fast.ai course, a superb course on Deep Learning, I stumbled upon a piece of advice that shifted my perspective on knowledge sharing and learning: "Start blogging." Well, here we are!

## Helps You Learn and Teach
One of the best ways to understand a subject is to explain it to others. Writing a blog post is an excellent method to do this. It not only reinforces my own understanding but also contributes to the learning of others.

## Meeting New People
Through blogging, I hope I have the chance to meet and connect with people who responded to my posts. It's a wonderful way to engage with a community of like-minded individuals and expand my professional network.

## Write for Your Past Self
When considering topics, I think about what would have helped me a year or even a week ago. We're often best positioned to assist those just a step behind us on the learning path. Our recent experiences can provide valuable insights to others who are just starting out.
